# type() is just like typeof operator in JS
# in python we have a native stdin that we can call as input() 
# bools are represented with capitals --> True, False
# AND, OR and NOT syntax --> and, or, not
# if ((age > 20 and age < 21) or age == 0): dosomething
# Checking for pointers/references is easy, just use 'is'

# in python, for 'in' is just like a regular forEach. No JS keys bullcrap. 
# To use regular for loops, use range: for iterable in range(1, 8):
# or more commonly if I want ]0,y] --> for iterable in range(y):
# We can also control the for loop skip with the third param like: for iterable in range(0, y, 2):
# while --> while (variable != condition): 
# break can be used normally 


# I can use len() to check the array length
# Negative indicies can be used to access the last element of the array
# Easy way to check if a list contains some value --> "whatever" in myList --> will return bool
# .append() one val end of list, .extend() multiple vals, .insert(pos, element) val at given pos
# .clear() removes all items, .pop(index) removes from list and returns it, if no index is given removes the last
# .remove(x) removes first element that matches x 
# .index(element) returns the index of the element --> can also have ranges --> .index(element, start, end)
# .count(x) returns the count of x on the list
# .reverse() --> yeah pretty much what it says
# .sort() --> yeah no JS tricks here, it really sorts numerically 
# .join() --> .join() --> str method but can be concatenated with lists like --> 'hey'.join(strList)
# --> join will combine the base string with each element of the list and returns a new str
# slice --> list[start:end:step] --> myList = [1,2,3] --> myList[2:] will return new list with [3]
# myList[1::1] --> returns [2,3]
# with slice we can also modify portions of lists like --> myList[0:1] = 'wut', will insert 'wut' into first pos of the list
# quick list reverse --> myList[::-1] --> slices the entire list starting from the back-end and returns a new str
# swapping values with comma syntax --> myName = ['bruno','giannotti']; myName[0], myName[1] = myName[1], myName[0];


# List comprehension is really cool, pretty much like filter, map, reduce all combined in one syntax
# --> [x*2 for x in myNumberList]
# --> [char.upper() for char in namesList]
# --> [person[0].upper() for person in personList] --> Makes the first char upper! Coolio!
# --> [num*100 for num in range(6)]
# --> [bool(value) for value in [0, '', [], 1]] --> False, False, False, True --> Please remember that [] is Falsy, different from JS!
# --> stringList = [str(num) for num in numbersList];
# --> odds = [num for num in numbersList if num % 2 == 0]
# --> cool = [num*2 if num % 2 == 0 else num/2 for num in numbersList]
# --> coolStringWithoutVowels = ''.join(char for char in strList if char not in 'aeiou')
# Hard coded 2d arrays --> nested = [[1,2,3], [1,2,1]]
# maze = [[num for num in range(0,2)] for value in range(0,2)]

# Dictionaries/Maps can be used just like in JS. something = {"hey": True}
# Can be used with 'dict' --> map = dict(name="myId") --> {"name": "myId"}
# Can be accessed like in JS with dynamic key --> map['name'] --> "myId"
# for myVal in map.values():
# for k in map.keys():
# for k,v in map.items():
